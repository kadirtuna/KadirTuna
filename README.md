<p>Hello, welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm a senior Electrical-Electronics Engineering and Computer Engineering(Double Major) student at Pamukkale University and would like to be Back-End Developer. </p>
 
<p>🌱I’m currently learning Django, Pyqt5 and some AI tools of Pytorch, Tensorflow for my thesis.</p>
<p>I love to work with Back-End technologies with soluting some hard problems and thinking what's going on behind, so you'll find more projects about back-end technologies when you look at my profile. Please don't be hesitate to ask me a question about them. I'm going to also be glad for that😁 </p>
